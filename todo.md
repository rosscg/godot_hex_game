## Todo:

### Now:

### Next:
* Add teammate obstructed tiles to tilemap exclusions
* Units can still cross over / fight in same cell
* Select unit by raycast, not cell_occupied

### Mid:
* Teams
* Fix: units move to next cell for combat even if it's away from target unit.
* Unit facing direction
* Disable interface during turn processing
* Stop units backtracking to centre of grid when in combat

### Low Priority:
* States - march, route, retreat, combat, ranged combat, fortify, stationary
* Units currently store their own astar node - probably only need to store one node per unit type

### Lowest Priority:
