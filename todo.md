## Todo:

### Low Priority:
* Units currently store their own astar node - probably only need to store one node per unit type
* Vector 0,0 is null, consider changing grid coords to begin at 1,1 to avoid problem.

### Lowest Priority:
* Declaring variables -- when to use onready, what := is for, when to declare type
